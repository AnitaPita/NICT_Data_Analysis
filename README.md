# NICT_Data_Analysis

It consists of a master file, which is still being completed, and a file off which the master builds and has been completed for demonstrative purposes.

Analysis tool for study that reads in a number of XML data files to output an excel spreadsheet that can analyze all user data.
This program is written in Java and employs use of the Apache POI to read in a few .xlsx spreadsheets and to build the output excel spreadsheet.

Additional accreditation to Marcelo Petrucelli, who initially built the website from which the data is being read, and Murillo Germano for a skeleton design for the spreadsheet output algorithm.
