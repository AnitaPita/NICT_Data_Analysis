# NICT_Data_Analysis
This program is built for the University of Ottawa Neuropsychology Laboratory.
It consists of a master file, which is still being completed, and a file off which the master builds and has been completed for demonstrative purposes.

Analysis tool for study that reads in a number of XML data files to output an excel spreadsheet that can analyze all user data.
This program is written in Java and employs use of the Apache POI to read in a few .xlsx spreadsheets and to build the output excel spreadsheet.

The master spreadsheet, once completed, will contain data for users in a study over multiple weeks for different types of games. The completed file, entitled "NICT_TDCS_Analysis.java", contains data for users over just two sessions, and only outputs one file for those sessions for one of the types of games.

Additional accreditation to Marcelo Petrucelli, who initially built the website from which the data is being read, and Murillo Germano for a skeleton design for the spreadsheet output algorithm.
